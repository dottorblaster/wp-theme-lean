Lean for WordPress
==================

Hi :)
This is my second theme for WordPress named Lean: I'm looking forward to a very content-is-king approach for my blog, so I decided to design some kind of one column beautiful theme to satisfy my need - as I am not seeing much of this stuff lookin' around.

This is **not** a parent theme, or a child theme: just upload it, select it and have fun.
If you want to edit my work, report credits please. It's the only price to pay.

Based on _s

On the road to the perfection I was looking for a parent theme or a starter theme to make my work easier, so I chose _s from ThemeShaper as a very promising starter kit. Very well! I believe I'm doing my best thanks to my hands (obviously) and thanks to this wonderful toolbox.

A theme designed for me
-----------------------

I designed this theme to achieve my personal approach to lean blogging, a concept about "writing when context is 0 and content is 1". Lookin' around to use this as a starter kit for your experiments, you could encounter some strings heavy customized to go on my blog. You are naturally authorised to let me know and even send pull requests to make them more standard.

One, lean, column
-----------------

This is my vision about "lean": you have this one column layout, no banners, no more distracting things, no monetary obligations. Just the quality, and the content that makes it readable and touchable through the "experience". Forget about a blog as a page where **you** emerge, see instead it as a page where the user can begin to explore contents created by you - in a way **the content emerges**, not the person who wrote it.
